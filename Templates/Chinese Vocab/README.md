# Mandarin Vocab Cards

Cards are created with the help of [Gustaf-C/anki-chinese-support-3](https://github.com/Gustaf-C/anki-chinese-support-3) and imported data from [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/)

## Card Styling
All styling should be called as `@import url('Chinese-Vocab.css');` from the card styling options and should be stored in the media folder. It will also internally call the [Core Card CSS](/General%20Styles/core-card.css) and [Flexoki Theme CSS](/General%20Styles/flexoki-theme.css) to set basic styling settings, font sizes and families and it will also need to be downloaded.
